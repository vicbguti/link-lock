### Twitter/X Launch Campaign

**Launch Thread:**
```
🚀 Excited to announce LinkLock is live on the Chrome Web Store!

"The inbox for links" - we spent 2 months building this and we think you'll love it.

1/ The problem: Browser history is useless. Link collections get lost.
   We save links for later... then never find them.

2/ What LinkLock does:
   ✨ One-click saving with screenshots
   🔍 Search instantly
   📁 Smart folders
   🔐 Pro: private + export

3/ The numbers:
   💰 Free: 500 links/month
   💰 Pro: $3.99/month unlimited
   No ads. No upsell. That's it.

4/ Tech stack for the curious:
   API: Express.js + SQLite → PostgreSQL
   Web: React + Vite + Tailwind
   Extension: Manifest v3
   Deploy: Railway

5/ Why we built this:
   - We couldn't find anything we liked
   - Wanted something dead simple
   - No bloat, no BS
   - Just works

6/ What's next:
   📱 Mobile app (iOS/Android)
   🤖 AI-powered search (maybe)
   🔗 Browser sync
   📊 Link analytics
   
7/ Download now:
   Chrome Web Store: [URL]
   Web app: linklock.app
   
   It's completely free to try. Would love your feedback 💙
